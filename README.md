UVC-delins is a very accurate and reasonably fast delins variant caller based on the VCF generated by UVC.

# How to install

The installation requirements for UVC-delins are the same as these for UVC (for the requirements for UVC, please check https://github.com/genetronhealth/uvc)
In total, the installation for UVC-delins should take about 5 minutes.

# How to use

The script uvcvcf-raw2delins-all.sh in the bin directory is the main executable that generates all VCF files related to the calling of delins variants.
Run bin/uvcvcf-raw2delins-all.sh without any command-line argument will display its usage help.
The usage help for uvcvcf-raw2delins-all.sh refers to the executable uvcvcf-raw2delins, which performs the actual variant calling.
The binary executable uvcvcf-raw2delins performs the actual calling of delins variants by combining SNV(s) and InDel(s) that are near each other from the same haplotype, where the SNV(s) and InDel(s) that are not from the same haplotype are still kept.  
The script uvcvcf-raw2delins-all.sh simply wraps around the binary executable uvcvcf-raw2delins.
